## How to Play Video (5:00)

### Introduction [0:00-0:30]

**VISUAL**: Host at table with game set up

**HOST**:

**VISUAL**: Camera pans across beautiful game setup

---

### Setup [0:30-1:00]

**HOST**: 
"Setup is simple. Each player starts with 20 CPU, 20 memory, and 20 storage."

**VISUAL**: Showing resource cubes being distributed

**HOST**: 
"Place the board between players. Each player takes ownership markers in their color."

**VISUAL**: Overhead shot of empty board

**HOST**: 
"Shuffle the chaos event deck. Set the entropy marker to zero. You're ready to play!"

---

### Turn Structure [1:00-1:30]

**VISUAL**: Animated diagram of 4 phases

**HOST**: 
"Each round has four phases:"

**VISUAL**: Phase cards being revealed
1. "Traffic Phase - Roll 2d10"
2. "Action Phase - 3 actions each"
3. "Resolution Phase - Check failures"
4. "Chaos Phase - If entropy â‰¥ 3"

**HOST**: 
"Let's see how each works."

---

### Traffic Phase Demo [1:30-2:15]

**VISUAL**: Close-up of blue d10 dice rolling

**HOST**: 
"First, roll 2d10 for incoming traffic."

**DICE RESULT**: Showing 6 and 8

**HOST**: 
"Fourteen requests! These flow through your load balancers to other services."

**VISUAL**: Demonstrating request flow with tokens

**HOST**: 
"Services can handle their capacity. Exceed it, and they start degrading."

---

### Action Phase Demo [2:15-3:15]

**VISUAL**: Player hand hovering over board

**HOST**: 
"Each player gets three actions. You can deploy new services..."

**VISUAL**: Placing a load balancer tile

**HOST**: 
"...repair failed services..."

**VISUAL**: Flipping a red tile back to green

**HOST**: 
"...or scale existing ones."

**VISUAL**: Adding capacity token to service

**HOST**: 
"Each action costs resources. Manage them wisely!"

**VISUAL**: Resource cubes being spent

---

### Resolution Phase Demo [3:15-4:00]

**VISUAL**: Service with too many load tokens

**HOST**: 
"Now we check for failures. This service has 8 load but only 5 capacity."

**VISUAL**: Service flipping to red (failed)

**HOST**: 
"It fails! Now we roll a d20 for cascade check."

**VISUAL**: d20 rolling, showing 6

**HOST**: 
"Six! That's under 8, so the failure cascades to connected services."

**VISUAL**: Failure spreading to adjacent tiles

**HOST**: 
"This is why redundancy matters!"

---

### Chaos Phase Demo [4:00-4:45]

**VISUAL**: Entropy marker at 7

**HOST**: 
"When entropy reaches 3 or higher, chaos strikes! Roll the d8."

**VISUAL**: Purple d8 rolling, showing 5

**HOST**: 
"Five - Disk Full! All database services lose half capacity this round."

**VISUAL**: Applying chaos effect to board

**HOST**: 
"Chaos events affect everyone. Plan accordingly!"

### Victory & Strategy [4:45-5:00]

**HOST**: 
"After 10 rounds, highest score wins! Points come from successful requests and healthy services."

**VISUAL**: Score tracking

**HOST**: 
"Pro tip: Defensive strategies win 90% of our simulated games. Build redundancy. Repair quickly. Survive the chaos."

**VISUAL**: Example of good defensive network

**HOST**: 
"Ready to master distributed systems? Back Pipeline & Peril on Kickstarter today!"

**END CARD**: Logo and Kickstarter info
