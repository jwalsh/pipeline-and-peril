* Hypothesis

The proposed dice system (d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, d4) will create appropriate probability distributions for game events, with failure rates between 15-25% under normal conditions and meaningful player decisions.

* Objectives

1. Calculate probability distributions for all dice types
2. Determine optimal difficulty thresholds
3. Validate that player choices meaningfully affect outcomes
4. Ensure dice availability doesn't limit gameplay

* Methodology

** Phase 1: Mathematical Analysis
- Calculate probability distributions for each die
- Model combined dice mechanics (e.g., d20 vs target numbers)
- Create probability tables for common scenarios

** Phase 2: Simulation
- Implement dice mechanics in Python
- Run 10,000 simulated service checks at various load levels
- Test cascade failure propagation rates

** Phase 3: Validation
- Compare simulation results to mathematical model
- Identify edge cases and anomalies
- Adjust parameters for target failure rates

* Expected Outcomes

| Scenario                  | Target Success Rate | Acceptable Range |
|---------------------------+--------------------+------------------|
| Light Load (1-3)          | 85-95%             | ±5%              |
| Normal Load (4-6)         | 75-85%             | ±5%              |
| Heavy Load (7-9)          | 60-70%             | ±5%              |
| Overload (10+)            | 30-40%             | ±10%             |

* Data Collection

- Number of dice rolls per game
- Distribution of roll results
- Success/failure rates by scenario
- Player perception of fairness
- Time spent on dice resolution

* Analysis Plan

1. Statistical analysis of dice distributions
2. Monte Carlo simulation of game scenarios
3. Sensitivity analysis of threshold values
4. Player decision impact measurement

* Success Criteria

- [ ] Mathematical model matches simulation (±2%)
- [ ] Failure rates within target ranges
- [ ] Player choices change success rate by >20%
- [ ] Resolution time <5 seconds per check
- [ ] Standard dice set sufficient for 4 players

* Resources Required

- Python with numpy, scipy, matplotlib
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- Dice rolling simulator
- Statistical analysis tools

* Risk Assessment

** Risks
- Dice mechanics too complex for casual players
- Probability distributions create "feel bad" moments
- Physical dice availability issues

** Mitigations
- Provide quick reference probability cards
- Implement "hero moments" for critical successes
- Design for standard polyhedral dice set
