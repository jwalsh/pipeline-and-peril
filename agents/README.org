#+DESCRIPTION: Agent definitions for game mechanics and AI players

* Agent Architecture

Agents are autonomous components that handle specific aspects of the game. Each agent has clearly defined responsibilities, interfaces, and behaviors.

* Agent Categories

** Game Mechanic Agents
Manage core game systems and rules.

** AI Player Agents
Implement different playing strategies.

** Analysis Agents
Collect and analyze game metrics.

** Coordinator Agents
Orchestrate multi-agent workflows.

* Agent Interface Specification

All agents implement this base interface:

#+begin_src python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

class BaseAgent(ABC):
    """Base class for all Pipeline & Peril agents."""
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
        self.name = name
        self.config = config or {}
        self.state = {}
        
    @abstractmethod
    def initialize(self) -> None:
        """Initialize agent state."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute agent's primary function."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def validate(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Validate input data."""
        pass
    
    def reset(self) -> None:
        """Reset agent to initial state."""
        self.state = {}
        self.initialize()

* Communication Protocol

** Message Format
#+begin_src json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T12:00:00Z",
  "source": "agent-name",
  "target": "agent-name or broadcast",
  "type": "request|response|event|command",
  "payload": {
    "action": "specific-action",
    "data": {}
  },
  "metadata": {
    "priority": "high|medium|low",
    "timeout": 5000,
    "retry": 3
  }
}
#+end_src

** Event Types
- `game.start` - New game initiated
- `turn.begin` - Player turn started
- `service.failed` - Service failure occurred
- `chaos.triggered` - Chaos event activated
- `game.end` - Game completed

* Agent Development Process

1. **Profile Creation**: Define agent specification
2. **Interface Implementation**: Implement base interface
3. **Unit Testing**: Test in isolation
4. **Integration Testing**: Test with other agents
5. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for efficiency
6. **Documentation**: Complete agent documentation

* Quality Standards

All agents must:
- [ ] Pass unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Log actions for debugging
- [ ] Provide performance metrics
- [ ] Include comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Support configuration override

* Next Steps

1. Implement base agent class
2. Create traffic-generator agent
3. Create chaos-agent
4. Develop testing framework
5. Build agent orchestrator
